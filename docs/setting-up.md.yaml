  Setting up Mythix UI is as simple as defining an [importmap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap) and including a `<script>` tag in your document's `<head>` tag to load Mythix UI. Obviously more complex things _can_ be done, such as customizing resource resolution, lazy loading resources / chunks, and dynamically importing what is needed. But that can all come later. For now, to start off with, just dump the following into your `<head>` tag:

  ```html
  <!-- Import Maps -->
  <script type="importmap">
    {
      "imports": {
        "@cdn/mythix-ui-core@${{majorVersion}}": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mythix-ui-core@${{majorVersion}}/dist/index.js"
      }
    }
  </script>

  <!-- Mythix UI -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mythix-ui-core@${{majorVersion}}/dist/index.js" type="module"></script>
  ```

  Many downstream scripts and components will import `'@cdn/mythix-ui-core'`, so it is important to ensure we setup our import map properly to start off with. Next, we just import Mythix UI itself from a common CDN. After this initial setup, we are now ready to use Mythix UI, including its built-in elements such as @see MythixElements.mythix-require;, and @see MythixElements.mythix-language-provider;.
